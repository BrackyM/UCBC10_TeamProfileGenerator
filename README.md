# Braxton M | UCBC10_TeamProfileGenerator | README

The objective of this Team Profile Generator is to learn more around Object-Oriented Programming by creating a team profile where a manager can be created and they can add engineers and interns to their teams and when they are finished adding members can close the program.

The Employee is the base in which the manager, engineer, and intern objects are built off of and are differentiated by the office number (manager), github username (engineers), and the attended university (interns).

This project requires Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest to generate a webpage using an HTML template that is filled in with superconstructors and classes.

The application was not given starter code


## Acceptance Criteria


```
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
